## üì∑ Usage and Screenshots üì∑

### Single serial number scan in

An example of how a single barcode would be scanned into the system.

### Bulk / multiple serial number scan in
![Bulk scan in](https://github.com/MitchStreet/Stock-Management-Program/blob/main/Bulk%20barcode%20scan%20in.gif?raw=true)

An example of how multiple or 'bulk' barcodes would be scanned into the system.

### Scan in options
![Scan in options](https://github.com/MitchStreet/Stock-Management-Program/blob/main/scan%20in%20serial%20num%20options.png?raw=true)

The user has the option between: normally scanning in the serial numbers and barcodes where everytime the 'Store' button is pressed, the optional information is reset - the situation this would be used in, is when single items are being scanned in at a time with different information attached to each of them. The other option available to the user is a 'Bulk mode' where the optional information is saved past each store and can be reused on the next item; used in conjunction with the 'Alt key' option the user can scan in items on mass with only a barcode scanner!

![Scan in alt key](https://github.com/MitchStreet/Stock-Management-Program/blob/main/scan%20in%20alt%20key.png?raw=true)

The 'Alt key' option makes it so the 'Enter' or 'Return' key presses the submit button. Some barcode scanners have the feature of simulating pressing the enter key after scanning a code, so the program supports these scanners by submitting the barcode as its scanned with the optional information automatically applied - for barcode scanners that lack that feature, don't worry! Pressing the enter key on the keyboard presses the 'Store' key when the option is enabled.
